# Original Pac-Man Arcade Game

## Game Concept
Pac-Man is a maze-chase arcade game where players control a character named Pac-Man through a maze filled with dots.

The objective is to eat all the dots in the maze while avoiding four colorful ghosts: Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde.

## Game Elements
Pac-Man: The player controls Pac-Man, a yellow, circular character with a missing slice (representing his mouth). Pac-Man moves through the maze in four directions: up, down, left, and right.

Ghosts: Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde are the ghosts that chase Pac-Man. Each ghost has its own behavior and strategy for catching the player.

Pellets and Power Pellets: The maze is filled with small dots (pellets) that Pac-Man eats for points. Additionally, there are larger, flashing dots (power pellets) that temporarily allow Pac-Man to eat ghosts for bonus points.

## Scoring
Eating pellets and fruits scattered throughout the maze earns points.

Points increase substantially when Pac-Man eats power pellets and turns the tables on the ghosts.

## Gameplay
The maze consists of pathways and walls through which Pac-Man navigates.

Ghosts roam the maze, and when Pac-Man collides with a ghost, he loses a life.

If Pac-Man successfully eats all the dots in the maze, the player advances to the next level.

## Legacy

The original Pac-Man game is remembered for its simplicity, addictive gameplay, and the enduring appeal of its characters.

## Notes

The project was brought to life using Python, entirely built upon the foundational concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), 
with a helping hand from the Pygame library, but also incorporates original assets from the Pac-Man game which provides a nostalgic touch to the project.

Start and Pause the game by pressing Spacebar.
